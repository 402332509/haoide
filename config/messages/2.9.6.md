Build 2.9.6
-----------
Release Date: 20 May 2015

* Bug Fix:
    - Fix issue #33
    - Fix issue #35

* Enhancement:
    - Add required check for XML utilities
    - Add required check for JSON utilities
    - Separate ``login`` feature from ``switch_project``
    - Add callback for ``switch_project`` for operations need switching, such as, ``deploy to server``, ``diff with server`` or ``retrieve from server``
    - Combine ``retrieve from server`` and ``retrieve from other server`` to only one command, just like ``deploy to server``, you can switch project when execute ``retrieve from server``
    - When ``reload_project_cache``, just if you selected at least one metadata object, reload will start, otherwise, do nothing

* New Feature
    - Add a new ``reload session cache`` command into ``Cache`` of the main menu for forced login

* Update
    - Because metadata.json of every project is stable, so save it into ``metadata.sublime-settings`` but not ``.config/metdata.json`` again
    - Remove ``check_workspace_available`` for export feature, because this check is useless

* Notes: 
    - You should restart your sublime after ``HaoIDE`` is upgraded
