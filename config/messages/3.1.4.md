* Update:
    -  ``Quick Goto`` is switched to standard sublime build-in, I changed the mousemap to bind with the standard feature , with this feature, you can quickly view the symbols in sublime, for example, when you see a statement like this ``AccountUtil.populateField()``, you can put focus in the method name, hold down ``shift`` and triple-click your left mouse, sublime will open the ``AccountUtil`` class and put focus in the selected method

* Restart your sublime when new version is installed
